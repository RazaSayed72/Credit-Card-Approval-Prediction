# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
This project builds a machine learning model to predict credit card approval based on applicant attributes like income, employment, and credit history. By automating the approval process, it helps financial institutions make faster, data-driven decisions while minimizing default risks and maximizing profits.

Abstract:
Banks receive a lot of applications for issuance of credit cards. Many of them are rejected for many reasons, like high-loan balances, low-income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual’s credit report. Manually analyzing these applications is error-prone and a time consuming process. This task can be automated with the power of machine learning. In this project, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do. 
 
Problem Statement: 
The task is to analyze and build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a credit card application should be approved or rejected based on various applicant attributes and historical credit data. The goal is to develop a model that can assist financial institutions in making informed decisions while minimizing the risk of default and maximizing profitability. 
 
They have given a problem to identify the customers segments which are eligible for Credit Card approval, so that they can specifically target these customers. 

Scope: 
●	Understand data by performing exploratory data analysis 
●	Training and building classification algorithm to predict if a customer will be approved with credit card or not 
●	Understand feature importance and improve the model 
●	Understand various model performance metrics and measure the performance of each model 
 
   Objective & Learning Outcome: 
The objective is to train a machine learning model using the provided dataset to predict the approval outcome for new credit card applications accurately. The model should generalize well to unseen data and provide a reliable assessment of the creditworthiness of applicants. 
Students should be able to predict credit card approval from records with the help of a classification model. They should also be able to perform EDA and re-build the model and check if there is any significant change in the predictive scores.
